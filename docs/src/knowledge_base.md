## Copy pasting in the browser

To enable copy-pasting in the browser, you will need to add the `--cfg=web_sys_unstable_apis` flag. For more information, please refer to the following links :

## CORS Errors

If the website is running on HTTPS, connections to insecure endpoints (like `ws` instead of `wss`) are forbidden because of [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS). There are four options to solve this issue:

- disable CORS in your browser
- add an SSL certificate to your ws server
- use a WS proxy to translate the `ws` connection to a secure one (`wss`)
- use a local WS proxy to remove CORS issue

```bash
# example of a local WS proxy (and with a orign header) using npx
npx @n4n5/proxy-ws -t ws://10.0.0.1:9001 -h '{"origin":"toto"}'
# will redirect ws://127.0.0.1:9001 -> ws://10.0.0.1:9001
# cors will not be an issue anymore with the local address 127.0.0.1
```

## Compilation crash

In certain cases, the compilation may heavily use the CPU and slow down the computer. This is due to the `cargo` process that is using all the available CPU. To solve this issue, you can use the `--jobs` flag to limit the number of jobs that `cargo` can run in parallel. Note that on linux, you can use the `nproc` command to get the number of available CPUs.

```bash
cargo build --jobs 10

# or
cargo build -j 10
```

Another simple solution is to create a `~/.cargo/config.toml` file and add the following content:

```toml
[build]
jobs = 10
```
