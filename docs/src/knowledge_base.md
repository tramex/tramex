## CORS Errors

If the website is running on HTTPS, connections to insecure endpoints (like `ws` instead of `wss`) are forbidden because of [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS). There are four options to solve this issue:

- disable CORS in your browser
- add an SSL certificate to your ws server
- use a WS proxy to translate the `ws` connection to a secure one (`wss`)
- use a local WS proxy to remove CORS issue

```bash
# example of a local WS proxy (and with a orign header) using npx
npx @n4n5/proxy-ws -t ws://10.0.0.1:9001 -h '{"origin":"toto"}'
# will redirect ws://127.0.0.1:9001 -> ws://10.0.0.1:9001
# cors will not be an issue anymore with the local address 127.0.0.1
```
