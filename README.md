Tramex is a project conducted in Télécom Paris and supported by the French State under the Call for Expressions of Interest (AMI) “Skills and Jobs of the Future” of the France 2030 Program, operated by the Caisse des Dépôts.

The goal of the project is to design a teaching tool for 4G and 5G air interface and access networks procedures. The tool is developed in Rust language.
It can be used inside a web environment for the design of labs supporting lectures. It can also be used in a standalone environment.
